# Move
This chess project tackles the movement of chess pieces concerning algebraic notation. <br />
It allows you to type in any chess piece name in all lower case along with the coordinates of that particular piece to retrieve all possible moves for that piece assuming no other pieces are on the board. <br />
Example: <br />
Output: Type in the name of the piece you want to see the potential moves of. <br />
input: knight <br />
Output: Enter the location of that piece:  <br />
input: d3 <br />
output: ('Possible Knight Moves ', ['b4', 'c5', 'e5', 'f4', 'f2', 'e1', 'c1', 'b2']) <br />
